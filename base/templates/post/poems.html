                    <p>
                        Breath
                        The beginning of man
                        For when Adam was but a vessel of dust
                        And The Eternal gave him the breath of life
                        That is when he was born
                        And the breath of life was a gift
                        And the breath of life gave Adam his soul
                        And the breath of life gave Adam consciousness
                        And the descendants of Adam
                        When they breathe
                        Do they not remember
                        The miracle that is life?
                        So breathe as your father Adam did
                        And do not deprive the soul of its desire
                        To live and breathe
                        As the breath is the genesis of the soul
                        And breath is the source of life
                        Breath is the start of it all

                        Say: Those who learn to breathe, verily they will never lose track
                        '
                        Say: So breathe, and take in everything
