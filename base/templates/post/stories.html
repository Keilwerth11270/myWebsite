                    <h4>Lamentations of the Dust</h4>
                    <p>
                        Prologue

                        A crack appeared in the firmament above the One World Trade Center. 
                        People on the streets of Manhattan found themselves watching and filming in awe as four figures descended from the sky. 
                        These four individuals, as soon as they found themselves on the street, were surrounded by the police, ambulances, and fire trucks. 
                        They laid on the streets of New York, unconscious. Several men and women in dark blue clothes came and put the four on stretchers and carried them away to a hospital. 

                        The first among them to wake up was a German man. Pale in complexion and donning a beard and mustache, he looked to find himself in a completely unfamiliar area. 
                        There were two strange men in brown trench coats, one taller than the other, standing above him. Upon noticing the patient, they tried to speak to him. 
                        The German recognized the language of the men, and tried to respond:

	                    "I do not know where I am, nor do I know where I came from. My name is Karl, and I am a citizen of RheinpreuBen."

                        The two men looked at each other in awe. The older man laying before them was none other than Karl Marx! 
                        But how could this be? How was Marx summoned to this time period, centuries after he died? 
                        They told him about when and where he was, but Marx did not have the energy to speak or even be surprised. 
                        He fell asleep, and the two men visited one of the other three people.
                        They approached the one woman in the group next. She slowly opened her eyes a few minutes after their arrival. They asked her who she was.
                        
                        "My name is Mary Wollstonecraft. Who are you?"
                        
                        The two men explained the situation to her, that she had descended from the sky and just woke up from a state of unconsciousness. 
                        Upon hearing of the year, she realized that somehow, she was transported to another time period. She found herself sweating and worried, and the two men noticed. 
                        They told her to remain here until they came back, and that it would take a while. In the meantime she would be free to watch whatever was on the television. 
                        They showed her how to operate the machine and left. She was quick to learn.

                    <h4>Self Annihilation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Self Annihilation

                        Prince Daiano

	                    "Prince Daiano has returned from his expedition!" an ironclad soldier cried out. I looked over the king's shoulder and found a faint smile on his face. 
                        He called for the gates to be opened so that he may welcome his son. Prince Daiano was a popular young man with ample love for everything and everyone, last I saw him. 
                        He, along with his siblings Varena and Carano were sent on a mission a few weeks ago by the king. 
                        The details were not discussed with the court, nor with myself, his personal aid and loyal protector. 

	                    Two guards pulled each of the large and heavily decorated doors open, and the lone prince entered. 
                        His figure was hidden under a plain brown cloak, and a hood prevented us at the throne from seeing his face. Had the guards truly confirmed that this was Prince Daiano? 
                        He gradually approached the throne, sparing not even a glance toward the court members lined up on the sides of the room.

	                    "Come, my son. Do not kneel, I want to hold you in my arms again. 
                            Come and embrace me, and let us all cheer, for the Lord has brought my eldest son back in one piece!"
	                    
                        The room went from silence to clamorous alleluias, as everyone was delighted to see the prince come home. I was still not convinced. Where were his siblings? 
                        Why wasn't he dressed in royal garb? I postured next to the king, just in case anything were to happen. He noticed this and gestured for me to back off. 
                        Despite my apprehension and instinct, I honored his command.

                    <h4>Letter To the FCPS School Board</h4>
                    <p>
                        To the dear members of the Fairfax County Public School Board,

	                    My name is Fahim Bashar. I am a graduate of Union Mill Elementary School, Liberty Middle School, and Centreville High School. 
                        For 11 out of my 12 years of K-12 education, I was a student at the Fairfax County Public schools. 
                        Centreville is a beautiful suburb, and the quality of education in FCPS is second to none. 
                        I, for one, am proud and blessed to have been given the opportunity to be taught in these schools. 
                        Thanks to the great teachers of FCPS, I got accepted into university, and now am about to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science. 
                        I recall waking up every morning, excited to hang out with my friends at school and share our lunches in the Cafeteria. 
                        I remember waking up on snowy days praying that Ryan McElveen would post about school closures or delays 
                        so I could stay at home and have hot chocolate while watching Hallmark movies or play outside with my friends. 
                        The field days at UMES were so much fun, especially the last day of school in the sixth grade. 
                        Playing games out in the grass during recess while Boulevard of Broken Dreams played on blast is one of my favorite memories from elementary school. 
                        Participating in the CVHS marching band as well, and having the opportunity to travel and compete was also a blessing that 
                        I'm sure not every school has the opportunity to do. FCPS provided me with many wonderful memories and for that I am grateful to you all.
                        
                        I write this letter to you all not to reminisce about the great things offered to me by FCPS. 
                        Rather, I come to you with a suggestion, one that I believe will be easy to implement given how capable every single one of you is, 
                        as well as the teachers and staff at every school in Fairfax County. As you all know, FCPS places a heavy emphasis on challenging students in the 
                        core subjects of language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. While I do agree that these subjects of study are necessary to correctly 
                        orient students and help them develop their ability to learn, something vital is missing from the curriculum. This subject was somehow overlooked 
                        despite possibly being the foundation of all knowledge. The designers of the general education curriculum at FCPS seem to have forgotten about 
                        philosophy.

                    <h4>Throne of Divinity [not going to continue]</h4>
                    <p>

                        It's time, isn't it?
                        For what?
                        For the next bloodletting.

                        Selection

                        "It's time to begin class!" Were the words that my professor started the day with. The same words that made 
                        everyone in the room let out a collective sigh in unison, me included.
                        "What are we going to learn today, Dr. Thirston?" I asked. I asked him every day, and every day he would respond with, 
                        "You'll see soon enough." But that wasn't the answer I got today.
                        He ignored me for a second and stood in front of the class, arms crossed. As he turned to look at me, a glint of light from the 
                        open windows made his glasses white and eyes invisible. I couldn't tell, but he looked almost depressed.

                        "The Chancellor would like to see you, Gabriel" He said in a rather quiet voice, "immediately."

                        I grabbed my bag and made my way out of the room. I turned back at the door only to see my best friend Randy mouth the words 
                        "Gabriel's in trouble". I pulled my bottom eyelid down and stuck my tongue out at him, which made him laugh.
                        "Immediately." Dr. Thirston repeated in a harsher tone.
                        I shut the door behind me and ran to the Chancellors office. The halls were clean and lights were bright. 
                        My mouth watered at the smell of waffles as I passed a classroom. Must have been a culinary arts class. 
                        As I approached the door to the Chancellors office, I heard some interesting dialogue coming from his room.

                        "Jonathan, now really isn't the time." A woman's voice was heard through the door.

                        "It's always the right time, Emily." The man responded. It was the Chancellor.

                        "Listen, I really have to get back to the nurse's office." Emily nervously said. Her shaking voice was obviously obvious.

                        "I know you've been suffering alone all this time. After Luke's death, you must have been in so much pain. Let my love bring you back. 
                        Please, Emily." It sounded like the Chancellor was getting closer to the nurse. I leaned my ear in closer. This is definitely interesting.
                        "No!" I heard a loud smack. Footsteps approached at lightning speed and before I knew it, the door slammed into my head and I went flying 
                        onto the hard floor.

                    <h4>On my Inability to Discuss Spirituality with my Peers</h4>
                    <p>
                        Naturalism 

                        The term "naturalism" has no very precise meaning in contemporary philosophy. Its current usage derives from debates in America 
                        in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed "naturalists" from that period included John Dewey, Ernest Nagel, Sidney 
                        Hook and Roy Wood Sellars. These philosophers aimed to ally philosophy more closely with science. They urged that reality is exhausted 
                        by nature, containing nothing "supernatural", and that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas of reality, including 
                        the "human spirit"

                	Naturalism, post on Stanford's Plato website
 
      	                Ever since high school, I found that more and more of my peers were identifying themselves as agnostic or atheist. I found it quite interesting, 
                        given I was raised in a religious household and viewed that as the default position for most people. The stance of atheism itself never quite 
                        made sense to me, but my friends never really seemed to care all that much to talk to me about it.
                        In my freshman year of university, I enrolled in a class called "The Theory of Knowledge'' with Philip Atkins, and there we learned about 
                        epistemology. Talking to my peers, roommates, and other general acquaintances I made throughout freshman year and in the class, I realized that 
                        most people were apatheistic, and naturalist in the ontological sense. What I mean by this is that the question of whether God exists, or whether 
                        there is a spiritual world that the human self can interact with exists, does not matter. Or rather, those questions are entirely irrelevant.
 
                        Empiricism

                        Empiricism, in philosophy, is the view that all concepts originate in experience, that all concepts are about or applicable to things that can 
                        be experienced, or that all rationally acceptable beliefs or propositions are justifiable or knowable only through experience.
      	                
                        Encyclopedia Britannica
 
      	                The idea that everything that exists can be measured by science was apparently a belief that many of my friends had. I think this idea that 
                        empiricism is the "highest" source of knowledge stems from science classes in the K-12 public education system. Students in public schools are 
                        taught about the history of scientific achievements, how we went from thinking that the four main elements composed all that existed to atoms 
                        being the foundation of all material things. The idea with science in school was that everything we needed to know could be tested and discovered 
                        through a scientific method.
