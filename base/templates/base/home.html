                        <h3>Who I am</h3>
                        <p>I recently graduated from Temple University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. 
                            After spending a few months on hiatus, I'm ready to start working on bigger things. Right now my
                            focus is on improving as a developer, and I hope to share what I learn on this page as I grow.

                    <h4>More about me</h4>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my skills as a developer, I have a ton of hobbies. The hobby that I think I have the most skill in is
                        would probably be writing. I love sharing what I come up with as a writer, and I have some of my works posted here
                        for your viewing pleasure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that I'm back in business I also plan on taking Japanese classes and learning some kind of martial art. 
                        Much of my university career happened during the COVID pandemic, so many school facilities like the gym were
                        hard to come by or closed. Now, it's time to sharpen both the body and the mind!
